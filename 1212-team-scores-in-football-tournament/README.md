| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |

team_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table represents a single football team.

<p>Table: <code>Matches</code></p>

<pre>+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     | 
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams. 
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the Teams table (team_id), and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals, respectively.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:

<ul>
	<li>A team receives <strong>three points</strong> if they win a match (i.e., Scored more goals than the opponent team).</li>
	<li>A team receives <strong>one point</strong> if they draw a match (i.e., Scored the same number of goals as the opponent team).</li>
	<li>A team receives <strong>no points</strong> if they lose a match (i.e., Scored fewer goals than the opponent team).</li>
</ul>

<p>Write an SQL query that selects the <code>team_id</code>, <code>team_name</code> and <code>num_points</code> of each team in the tournament after all described matches.</p>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>num_points</code> <strong>in decreasing order</strong>. In case of a tie, order the records by <code>team_id</code> <strong>in increasing order</strong>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>
