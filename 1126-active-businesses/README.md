<pre>+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| business_id   | int     |
| event_type    | varchar |
| occurences    | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(business_id, event_type) is the primary key of this table.
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occurred at some business for a number of times.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>average activity</strong> for a particular <code>event_type</code> is the average <code>occurences</code> across all companies that have this event.</p>

<p>An <strong>active business</strong> is a business that has <strong>more than one</strong> <code>event_type</code> such that their <code>occurences</code> is <strong>strictly greater</strong> than the average activity for that event.</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to find all <strong>active businesses</strong>.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 
Events table:
+-------------+------------+------------+
| business_id | event_type | occurences |
+-------------+------------+------------+
| 1           | reviews    | 7          |
| 3           | reviews    | 3          |
| 1           | ads        | 11         |
| 2           | ads        | 7          |
| 3           | ads        | 6          |
| 1           | page views | 3          |
| 2           | page views | 12         |
+-------------+------------+------------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+-------------+
| business_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong>  
The average activity for each event can be calculated as follows:
- 'reviews': (7+3)/2 = 5
- 'ads': (11+7+6)/3 = 8
- 'page views': (3+12)/2 = 7.5
The business with id=1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8), so it is an active business.
