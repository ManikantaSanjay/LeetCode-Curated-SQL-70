* Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) seq: This CTE generates a series of numbers from 0 to the maximum number of transactions done by any user in a single visit. This is achieved using a recursive SELECT statement that adds 1 to the previous transactions_count on each iteration. The recursive operation stops when transactions_count equals the maximum transactions count from the subquery.
​
* CTE trans_count: This CTE aggregates the data from the Visits and Transactions tables. It counts the number of transactions (transaction_date) for each user's visit (user_id, visit_date).
​
* Final SELECT Statement: This statement retrieves the transaction count from the seq CTE and calculates the number of visits for each transaction count by joining the seq and trans_count CTEs on transactions_count. It uses the COALESCE function to replace NULL with 0 in case there are transaction counts in the seq CTE that do not exist in trans_count. This could happen if, for example, no user had a certain number of transactions in a visit. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by transactions_count, and the ORDER BY clause orders the result set by transactions_count in ascending order.
​
This query helps to determine how many visits had each possible number of transactions. For example, you can find out how many visits had no transactions, how many had 1 transaction, how many had 2 transactions, and so on, up to the maximum number of transactions recorded in a single visit.
